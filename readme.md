#boost threads example

This is a package that contains few (basic) experiments related with boost threads. 
It implements and extends the examples as described in antonym blog for the tutorial [Threading with Boost - Part I: Creating Threads](http://antonym.org/2009/05/threading-with-boost-part-i-creating-threads.html) 

- run a function in a thread (passing arguments)
- run a functor as thread
- run class methods in using thread
- encapsulate threads in a class and assign them to member functions
